# Note-taking Web Application

This is a simple note-taking web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, save, and delete notes within the application. The notes are stored locally using the browser's localStorage feature.

## Features

- **Add Note**: Users can add a new note by clicking on the "Add Note" button. This creates a new note with an editable textarea.
- **Save Note**: Users can save their notes by clicking the save icon. The notes are saved automatically when the textarea loses focus.
- **Delete Note**: Users can delete a note by clicking the trash icon associated with each note.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored locally using the browser's localStorage, allowing users to access their notes even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the web application.
- **style.css**: Contains the CSS styles for styling the application layout and components.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code for adding functionality to the application, including adding, saving, and deleting notes.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Start adding your notes using the "Add Note" button.
